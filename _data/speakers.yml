# I think we python developers should contribute to the standards of **pythonic thinking** to make this community bigger and better. Writing software with maximum readability and of global standards. Imagining a life where people read python code like they are reading a book. And as well as following the best coding practices which include one line deployments and running the software.
#
# *I have been organizing and taking part in teaching web development through python and Django framework, Distributed computing as well as docker and Kubernetes to my juniors in college* and tell them about what I learned from writing a bazillion lines of code and what is the best practice.
