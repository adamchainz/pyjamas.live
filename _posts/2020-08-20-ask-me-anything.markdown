##### Let's do it together

We know that speaking at a conference, especially for the first time, can be scary at first. But it's a wonderful experience sharing your story to Pythonistas around the world.

We would like to help, we would like to make it easy for you. We also want to hear different voices in the Python community so we don't want you, who got a great idea and a fascinating story, to turn away and not submitting because you have no idea how to write down a proposal that will make the reviews love your talk. So let us do it together, shall we?

---

##### Ok, so what's next?

We know that you have lots of questions:

* How to write a good proposal?
* What do I need to do to submit a proposal?
* Are the talks going to be live or recorded?
* How to present online?
* How does the time zone things work?
* Is my idea a good idea?

Don't worry, we got you covered. We will have 2 **Ask me anything** workshop sessions for you to attend. At the workshop, we, the organisers of Pyjamas Conf 2020, who are also experienced speakers at various conferences will answer questions from you. If you feel comfortable, we can also brainstorm ideas together.

##### How to join the workshop?

Just sign up to the Zoom Webinar here:

[Session 1 - 27th Aug 2020 6pm UTC](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_19UStPQCQveiZiVBbdwHRg){: .btn-new}
[Session 2 - 28th Aug 2020 8am UTC](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BAGeJ_Z4QxaRsI6tDnNEvw){: .btn-new}

We recommend signing up for either one of those sessions. However, if you feel the need for joining 2 sessions, you can sign up to both.

##### What if I want some 1-1 mentoring?

I know discussions with everyone during the workshop may not be right for you. If you are a new speaker and if you need help submitting to Pyjamas Conf 2020, please get in touch by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PyjamasConf) or [email](mailto:contact@pyjamas.live).

We cannot promise a 1-1 mentor assigned to you but the organising team will try to help as much as we can.

---

##### What if I want to speak in another language, not English?

You are welcome to do so! However, we would suggest you submit to the community space, where we may bundle your talk together with other speakers who would like to give a talk in the same language. We think bundling up talks in the same language will be much better for the audiences who are interested in those talks. We also welcome organisers to co-organise these talk blocks with us, just [submit a proposal to the community space](https://pyjamas.live/cfp/).

---

##### Let's talk about accessibility

If you have any special needs, let us know. We will try our best to not let it stops you from submitting and giving talks.

---

##### Spread the words

Please let your friends, family, co-workers and your local community know about Pyjamas Conf and the free CfP workshop.
